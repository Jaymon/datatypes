# Datatypes

Datatypes is my personal standard library and is a core dependency of many of my other python projects.


I had been creating the same types of classes over and over and I finally decided to collect all those similar classes into a central location that I can pull into multiple projects, and Datatypes was born.


## Installation

Install latest stable with the following command.

    $ pip install datatypes
    
Or install the latest and greatest from source:

    $ pip install -U "git+https://github.com/jaymon/datatypes#egg=datatypes"
